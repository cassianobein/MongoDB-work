This is the Flow to set authentication :

Start MongoDB without access controls - break it down like a mudslide

mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1

Connect to the instance.

mongo --port 27017

Create the user administrator.

use admin
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "myUserAdmin",
        pwd: "abc678",
        roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
      }
    )
Re-start the MongoDB instance with access control.

mongod --auth --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1

Authenticate as the user administrator.

Start a mongo shell with the -u , -p , and the --authenticationDatabase command line options:

mongo --port 27017 -u "myUserAdmin" -p "abc123" --authenticationDatabase "admin"

An user with the role userAdminAnyDatabase can manage the users of all the databases.

For routine user creation, you must possess the following permissions:

To create a new user in a database, you must have the createUser action on that database resource.
To grant roles to a user, you must have the grantRole action on the roleâ€™s database.
MongoDB stores all user information, including name, password, and the user's authentication database, in the system.users collection in the admin database.
